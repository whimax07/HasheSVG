# HasheSVG
Another attempted at art. This time using the hashes of files to make an SVG. You pass a file in and using a colour scheme and the hash makes a image made out of trinagles. The hashed used can also be set.

This repo has been split out from DietCoke as the rest of DietCoke was written when I was new to programming. The Python version is the main version.
